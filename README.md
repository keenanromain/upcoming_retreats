# upcoming_retreats

This project was an excercise in web scraping with Python's Beautiful Soup module.
The goal was to build a simple website that displays all 10-day S.N. Goenka style Vipassana retreats in the continental US.
This was achieved by first parsing out the 10-day retreat contents from each meditation center's website and aggregating the results into a file to be rendered.
